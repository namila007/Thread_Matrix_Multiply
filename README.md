# Thread_Matrix_Multiply [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/namila007/Thread_Matrix_Multiply.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/namila007/Thread_Matrix_Multiply) [![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/namila007/Thread_Matrix_Multiply?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

## Inserting data
  * Data is inserted by two file `A.txt` and `B.txt`
* A.txt contains 
		 * row size of the matrix
		* column size of the matrix
		* values of the matrix
* user can generate any amount of matrix using given `generate.m` matlab file by giving 
		`generate(<A row>,<A column>,<B row size>,<B column size>)`

## Output Data:
	
  * Data will be written to `output.txt` on same folder
* output.txt contains;
    * row size of the final matrix
	* column size of the final matrix
	* values of the final matrix			

## Results:
  * Results of the testcases are given in the `TESTCASE` folder.
* Expected Output(`TestX_exp_output.txt`) was generated by generate.m file and compared with the output(`TestX_output.txt`) given but the program.
	* Testcase1:
		~A(100*10)
		~B(10*100)
		~expectedoutput was matched with generated output values
	* Testcase2:
		~A(5*20)
		~B(20*6)
		~expectedoutput was matched with generated output values
	* Testcase3:
		~A(150*1)
		~B(1*150)
		~expectedoutput was matched with generated output values
	* Testcase4:
		~A(1*80)
		~B(80*1)
		~expectedoutput was matched with generated  output values
	* Testcase1:
		~A(1000*1000)
		~B(1000*1000)
		~expectedoutput was closely matched with generated output values.last values of decimals are bit differents
