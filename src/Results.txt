Inserting data;

	~Data is inserted by two file A.txt and B.txt
	~A.txt contains 
		>row size of the matrix
		>column size of the matrix
		>values of the matrix
	~user can generate any amount of matrix using given generate.m matlab file by giving 
			<A row>,<A column>,<B row size>,<B column size>

Results:

	~Results of the testcases are given in the TESTCASE folder.
	~Expected Output(TestX_exp_output.txt) was generated and compared with the output(TestX_output.txt) given but the program.
	~Testcase1:
		~A(100*10)
		~B(10*100)
		~expectedoutput was matched with generated output values
	~Testcase2:
		~A(5*20)
		~B(20*6)
		~expectedoutput was matched with generated output values
	~Testcase3:
		~A(150*1)
		~B(1*150)
		~expectedoutput was matched with generated output values
	~Testcase4:
		~A(1*80)
		~B(80*1)
		~expectedoutput was matched with generated  output values
	~Testcase1:
		~A(1000*1000)
		~B(1000*10000)
		~expectedoutput was closely matched with generated output values.last values of decimals are bit differents
